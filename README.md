### What is UX?
UX design is the process of designing (digital or physical) products that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with.

### How do UX designers add value to a product team?
UX designers must have extensive knowledge about the people that a website is geared to. They then use this knowledge to create the best possible design and desired functionality of the website that they are working on. This takes the design legwork away from the Front-End devs and also allows the website to be more customized towards the best possible user experience.

### What does the daily work of a "UX Designer" look like?
The initial stage for a UX designer on a project involves user research, getting information about the people (users) that they will be designing for. This is followed by sketching out the core features of the site, writing out concepts of people and tasks that they hope to achieve on the site, and building paper prototypes. Paper prototypes proceed wireframes. "They [wireframes] often start as very basic black and white designs moving on to interactive designs where users can navigate between the different pages like they will with the final product to high-res designs which give the user a really clear idea of what the final product could like." Each stage is followed with user testing. Wireframes eventually lead to mockups which "show exactly what the design will look like when brought to life so they can be used as a guide when development starts."

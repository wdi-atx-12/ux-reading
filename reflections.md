# Research / Reflections on UX Design

Write your reflections here using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

I read [this article](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design) featured on https://www.interaction-design.org.

One major takeaway is the comparison to graphic design. UX design encompasses non-graphical aspects of the interface and styling and is centered around user research. Ultimately their goal is to make an interface look, feel and function "right".  

UX design is also an iterative process, much like coding. Except where in coding the iteration cycle loops when we pass tests derived from customer requirements, UX designers go straight to the user to validate their design. And user testing can't be automated.

The user facing aspect of UX is the most fascinating to me. I've noticed in recent years a proliferation of new customer-facing roles in the tech industry (my favorite: "technology evangelist"). The trend confirms to me that the answer to "what will we do when the machines program themselves" is "we'll be paid to come up with user requirements".

Along these lines, I would want to ask an experienced UX designer the following questions:
- Do you see UX design involving more coding as tools evolve to make it easier, and if so will that blur the lines between web development and UX, or do you see the reverse happening with ever greater specialization?
- Are there trends to automate the work of UX design, much as frameworks have transformed web dev?
- How do you ensure that test users are a representative sample? Do you rely mostly on marketing folks to do that research or is some sociology/statistics knowledge useful?

# What is UX? 

UX stands for User Experience. The job of an UX designer is to enhance the user satisfaction by improving the users ability to use a website. 

# How do UX Designers add value to a product team / company?

I actually met some UX designers at a Halloween party. They were saying that their job was to make wireframes for developers to work on, tell the developers how they want certain things to make whoever is visiting the website easier. They make journey maps, meaning they write out the path of the website creation and also wireframes which is a blueprint of how the website is going to be laid out. UX designers are on the product team / company to make the user experience better. Better user experience, more customers, more money.

# What does the daily work of a "UX Designer" look like?

From what I am reading, there are a lot of UX Designers who work remotely. They work closely with their clients. When they are in the office, they are working. No time for playing around. They have "design sprints." 

A design sprint is a five day series of interactive exercises. They take the product from initial design idea through prototyping and user testing. It's a process that aims their efforts at hitting clearly defined goals. 

I also asked a friend who's a UX designer.

- Get to work around 8am (I'm an early bird)
- Make a smoothie
- Drink smoothie while I check email + make a to-do list for the day
- Continue progress on some stuff from the week before, it could be user research / wireframing / sketching / prototyping work
- Attend daily stand up with lead designer, engineers (about 10), and product manager. We all collectively stare at the JIRA board and learn about what's being worked today
- Share any design progress with the team. If there's something I want to get their feedback on, I'll show visual designs and take notes based on amount of feedback.
- Go back to my desk or some other place at the office, and continue my work. At any given day, I could be simply sketching on my own, or meeting with someone from the user research team to consolidate/synthesize feedback, or prototyping some stuff on origami, framer, or after effects.
- Eat lunch with colleagues, or maybe at my desk if I have a lot going on
- Review some work-in-progress stuff with other designers, if I'm looking for feedback on something. Lead designer on my team is incredible, and gives solid feedback which I then use to help explore more solutions to problems I'm having
- Maybe there's a design critique, so we (designers) go critique some internal work in progress designs
- Sometimes we (designers) also meet with the design manager and go over all the stuff we have on our plates. This helps the design manager make sure that all the designers are not too overwhelmed, and have just enough on our plates
- Chill with other colleagues
- Continue working
- Go home

2. What is "UX"?

    UX stands for user experience. It is an area of teach development that focuses on the quality of interactions between customers/users and the products they use. A good UX is usually defined by it's elegance and ease of use. It is a combination of engineering, marketing, usability, and interface design.

3. How do UX Designers add value to a product team / company?
    
    A UX designer adds value to a product team/company by providing the user experience ease and visual asthetics.

4. What does the daily work of a "UX Designer" look like?

    There is a UX Design Process that includes research, design, prototyping, testing, and measurement. UX designers have to be good problem solvers as well as have a good understanding of people and how they work. Every time there is a new product, UX designers first as these questions called product thinking which helps designers create better products. There are many different types of methodologies but most of them follow the development cylces of determining objectives and quantifying user needs, evaluating alternatives, reasearch, creating a prototype, validate, plan, and test. A lot of times a UX designer may ask these questions before starting any project: 

    ```
    This product is for: (Your Audience)

    It will help them solve this problem: (The Problem)

    We will do this by: (The Strategy)

    We expect a working product to: (The Objective)

    Once you’ve done this definition – you can move on to deciding on the features.

## What is UX?
UX Design is short for user experience design. It is a broad term that covers a wide variety of areas of specialization, but it is essentially all the research, theory, wireframing, and prototyping that goes into designing the way a user interacts with a product. This can cover digital or physical products, but the term is mostly used for software and web app designers.

## How do UX designers add value to a team/company?
UX designers are a critical part of the process of developing a product. There is quite a bit of theory and research that goes into making products as fun and effortless to use as possible, covering everything from fonts to colors to element placement and spacing to the way a user will navigate through a website. It seems like a UX designer's job is to take a particular product and learn how to present that product to users, and then communicate their vision to the developers.

## What does the daily work of a UX designer look like?
From what I can tell, it varies from company to company and project to project, and also changes a lot over the course of a product's development cycle. The primary objectives I have seen a lot are conducting market research, creating personas(fictional archetypes that are supposed to represent different types of users and how they will interact with the product), building wireframes(rougher sketches of the project mostly focusing on layout), building prototypes(more finely detailed visual representations of the product that cover fonts, colors, pixel-perfect layout, and user interfaces), and user testing and iteration on the initial product.

## Questions to ask
- What qualities would you say makes a web developer easy to work with from the perspective of a UX designer? Hard to work with?
- What are some basic design tips you would offer for smaller-scale personal projects where we don't have the ability to work with a designer?

## UX/UI Reflections

I ended up reading this article on UX/UI Design: https://blog.prototypr.io/what-is-ux-design-common-misconceptions-and-ux-myths-39fe98cc6d23

UX is User Experience. What this means is it means that UX Designers design the overall feel, look, and emotion in a product that makes it marketable. UX Designers use research to see what their users want in a product. UX design is the journey of creating the UI (User Interface) destination.

What UX designers typically do is:


1. Analyze business goals and technical specifications
2. Create competitive analysis reports
3. Craft personas based on their research
4. Sitemap the information they receive
5. Experience the user's journey
6. Create wireframes
7. They use interactive design
8. Create interactive prototypes
9. Test Usability
10. Create appealing aesthetics


UX designers bring the appeal to the product that increases a business' chance for success. UX design isn't all about aesthetics. It's also about how it feels and works for the user. They add value to the company by creating a user experience.

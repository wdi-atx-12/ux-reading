# Research / Reflections on UX Design

### Some readings on UX
- [What the #$%@ is UX Design?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovj4hFxko7c)
- [What Does a UX Designer Actually Do?](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-does-a-ux-designer-actually-do/)
- [User experience design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design)

### The basics (briefly)
What is UX?
- short for **U**ser e**x**perience
- everything that affects a user's interaction with a product.

### Why is UX important?
A UX designer uses a set of tools/techniques to take the **user's needs into account at every stage of a product's life cycle**.

### Further questions
- How do you get in the mindset of "how can I make the UX for this product better/best for a user?"
- Do you ever see a poorly designed product and reach out to the creator/developer/designer?
